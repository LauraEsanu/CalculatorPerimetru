# Geometric Perimeter Calculator 

Welcome to the Geometric Perimeter Calculator repository! This application is designed to calculate the perimeters of various geometric figures such as squares, rectangles, and triangles. It's a simple tool to help you quickly determine the perimeter of different shapes.

## Features

The Geometric Shape Calculator currently supports the following shapes:

- Trapeze
- Rectangle
- Square
- Triangle
- Parallelogram

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- Java IDE installed on your computer.
  
## Getting Started
